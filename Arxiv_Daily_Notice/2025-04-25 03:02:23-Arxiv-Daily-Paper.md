 - **Abstract**
 Advanced sound zone control (SZC) techniques typically rely on massive multi-channel loudspeaker arrays to create high-contrast personal sound zones, making single-loudspeaker SZC seem impossible. In this Letter, we challenge this paradigm by introducing the multi-carrier parametric loudspeaker (MCPL), which enables SZC using only a single loudspeaker. In our approach, distinct audio signals are modulated onto separate ultrasonic carrier waves at different frequencies and combined into a single composite signal. This signal is emitted by a single-channel ultrasonic transducer, and through nonlinear demodulation in air, the audio signals interact to virtually form multi-channel outputs. This novel capability allows the application of existing SZC algorithms originally designed for multi-channel loudspeaker arrays. Simulations validate the effectiveness of our proposed single-channel MCPL, demonstrating its potential as a promising alternative to traditional multi-loudspeaker systems for achieving high-contrast SZC. Our work opens new avenues for simplifying SZC systems without compromising performance.
