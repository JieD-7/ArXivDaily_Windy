#### Variational Autoencoder for Personalized Pathological Speech Enhancement

 - **Abstract**
 The generalizability of speech enhancement (SE) models across speaker conditions remains largely unexplored, despite its critical importance for broader applicability. This paper investigates the performance of the hybrid variational autoencoder (VAE)-non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model for SE, focusing primarily on its generalizability to pathological speakers with Parkinson's disease. We show that VAE models trained on large neurotypical datasets perform poorly on pathological speech. While fine-tuning these pre-trained models with pathological speech improves performance, a performance gap remains between neurotypical and pathological speakers. To address this gap, we propose using personalized SE models derived from fine-tuning pre-trained models with only a few seconds of clean data from each speaker. Our results demonstrate that personalized models considerably enhance performance for all speakers, achieving comparable results for both neurotypical and pathological speakers.
#### Room Impulse Response Estimation through Optimal Mass Transport Barycenters

 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS); Signal Processing (eess.SP)

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we consider the problem of jointly estimating a set of room impulse responses (RIRs) corresponding to closely spaced microphones. The accurate estimation of RIRs is crucial in acoustic applications such as speech enhancement, noise cancellation, and auralization. However, real-world constraints such as short excitation signals, low signal-to-noise ratios, and poor spectral excitation, often render the estimation problem ill-posed. In this paper, we address these challenges by means of optimal mass transport (OMT) regularization. In particular, we propose to use an OMT barycenter, or generalized mean, as a mechanism for information sharing between the microphones. This allows us to quantify and exploit similarities in the delay-structures between the different microphones without having to impose rigid assumptions on the room acoustics. The resulting estimator is formulated in terms of the solution to a convex optimization problem which can be implemented using standard solvers. In numerical examples, we demonstrate the potential of the proposed method in addressing otherwise ill-conditioned estimation scenarios.
#### MoonCast: High-Quality Zero-Shot Podcast Generation

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in text-to-speech synthesis have achieved notable success in generating high-quality short utterances for individual speakers. However, these systems still face challenges when extending their capabilities to long, multi-speaker, and spontaneous dialogues, typical of real-world scenarios such as podcasts. These limitations arise from two primary challenges: 1) long speech: podcasts typically span several minutes, exceeding the upper limit of most existing work; 2) spontaneity: podcasts are marked by their spontaneous, oral nature, which sharply contrasts with formal, written contexts; existing works often fall short in capturing this spontaneity. In this paper, we propose MoonCast, a solution for high-quality zero-shot podcast generation, aiming to synthesize natural podcast-style speech from text-only sources (e.g., stories, technical reports, news in TXT, PDF, or Web URL formats) using the voices of unseen speakers. To generate long audio, we adopt a long-context language model-based audio modeling approach utilizing large-scale long-context speech data. To enhance spontaneity, we utilize a podcast generation module to generate scripts with spontaneous details, which have been empirically shown to be as crucial as the text-to-speech modeling itself. Experiments demonstrate that MoonCast outperforms baselines, with particularly notable improvements in spontaneity and coherence.
#### AdaST: Dynamically Adapting Encoder States in the Decoder for End-to-End Speech-to-Text Translation
 - **Authors:** Wuwei Huang, Dexin Wang, Deyi Xiong
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Computation and Language (cs.CL); Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14185

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14185

 - **Abstract**
 In end-to-end speech translation, acoustic representations learned by the encoder are usually fixed and static, from the perspective of the decoder, which is not desirable for dealing with the cross-modal and cross-lingual challenge in speech translation. In this paper, we show the benefits of varying acoustic states according to decoder hidden states and propose an adaptive speech-to-text translation model that is able to dynamically adapt acoustic states in the decoder. We concatenate the acoustic state and target word embedding sequence and feed the concatenated sequence into subsequent blocks in the decoder. In order to model the deep interaction between acoustic states and target hidden states, a speech-text mixed attention sublayer is introduced to replace the conventional cross-attention network. Experiment results on two widely-used datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art neural speech translation models.
