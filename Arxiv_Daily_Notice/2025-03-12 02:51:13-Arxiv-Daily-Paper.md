 - **Abstract**
 We tackle the task of long-form music generation--particularly the challenging \textbf{lyrics-to-song} problem--by introducing YuE, a family of open foundation models based on the LLaMA2 architecture. Specifically, YuE scales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of music while maintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal melodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through (1) track-decoupled next-token prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2) structural progressive conditioning for long-context lyrical alignment, and (3) a multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to converge and generalize. In addition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for music generation, enabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into an English rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional generation. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or even surpasses some of the proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility. In addition, fine-tuning YuE enables additional controls and enhanced support for tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation, we show that YuE's learned representations can perform well on music understanding tasks, where the results of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE benchmark.

#### FilmComposer: LLM-Driven Music Production for Silent Film Clips
 - **Authors:** Zhifeng Xie, Qile He, Youjia Zhu, Qiwei He, Mengtian Li
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Multimedia (cs.MM); Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08147

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08147

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we implement music production for silent film clips using LLM-driven method. Given the strong professional demands of film music production, we propose the FilmComposer, simulating the actual workflows of professional musicians. FilmComposer is the first to combine large generative models with a multi-agent approach, leveraging the advantages of both waveform music and symbolic music generation. Additionally, FilmComposer is the first to focus on the three core elements of music production for film-audio quality, musicality, and musical development-and introduces various controls, such as rhythm, semantics, and visuals, to enhance these key aspects. Specifically, FilmComposer consists of the visual processing module, rhythm-controllable MusicGen, and multi-agent assessment, arrangement and mix. In addition, our framework can seamlessly integrate into the actual music production pipeline and allows user intervention in every step, providing strong interactivity and a high degree of creative freedom. Furthermore, we propose MusicPro-7k which includes 7,418 film clips, music, description, rhythm spots and main melody, considering the lack of a professional and high-quality film music dataset. Finally, both the standard metrics and the new specialized metrics we propose demonstrate that the music generated by our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality, consistency with video, diversity, musicality, and musical development.

#### Mellow: a small audio language model for reasoning

 - **Abstract**
 Multimodal Audio-Language Models (ALMs) can understand and reason over both audio and text. Typically, reasoning performance correlates with model size, with the best results achieved by models exceeding 8 billion parameters. However, no prior work has explored enabling small audio-language models to perform reasoning tasks, despite the potential applications for edge devices. To address this gap, we introduce Mellow, a small Audio-Language Model specifically designed for reasoning. Mellow achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing small audio-language models and surpasses several larger models in reasoning capabilities. For instance, Mellow scores 52.11 on MMAU, comparable to SoTA Qwen2 Audio (which scores 52.5) while using 50 times fewer parameters and being trained on 60 times less data (audio hrs). To train Mellow, we introduce ReasonAQA, a dataset designed to enhance audio-grounded reasoning in models. It consists of a mixture of existing datasets (30% of the data) and synthetically generated data (70%). The synthetic dataset is derived from audio captioning datasets, where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate detailed and multiple-choice questions focusing on audio events, objects, acoustic scenes, signal properties, semantics, and listener emotions. To evaluate Mellow's reasoning ability, we benchmark it on a diverse set of tasks, assessing on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, including audio understanding, deductive reasoning, and comparative reasoning. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies to explore the impact of projection layer choices, synthetic data generation methods, and language model pretraining on reasoning performance. Our training dataset, findings, and baseline pave the way for developing small ALMs capable of reasoning.
