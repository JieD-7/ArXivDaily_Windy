 - **Abstract**
 Locating the right sound effect efficiently is an important yet challenging topic for audio production. Most current sound-searching systems rely on pre-annotated audio labels created by humans, which can be time-consuming to produce and prone to inaccuracies, limiting the efficiency of audio production. Following the recent advancement of contrastive language-audio pre-training (CLAP) models, we explore an alternative CLAP-based sound-searching system (CLAP-UI) that does not rely on human annotations. To evaluate the effectiveness of CLAP-UI, we conducted comparative experiments with a widely used sound effect searching platform, the BBC Sound Effect Library. Our study evaluates user performance, cognitive load, and satisfaction through ecologically valid tasks based on professional sound-searching workflows. Our result shows that CLAP-UI demonstrated significantly enhanced productivity and reduced frustration while maintaining comparable cognitive demands. We also qualitatively analyzed the participants' feedback, which offered valuable perspectives on the design of future AI-assisted sound search systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, fake audio detection has gained significant attention, as advancements in speech synthesis and voice conversion have increased the vulnerability of automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems to spoofing attacks. A key challenge in this task is generalizing models to detect unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks. Although existing approaches have shown promising results, they inherently suffer from overconfidence issues due to the usage of softmax for classification, which can produce unreliable predictions when encountering unpredictable spoofing attempts. To deal with this limitation, we propose a novel framework called fake audio detection with evidential learning (FADEL). By modeling class probabilities with a Dirichlet distribution, FADEL incorporates model uncertainty into its predictions, thereby leading to more robust performance in OOD scenarios. Experimental results on the ASVspoof2019 Logical Access (LA) and ASVspoof2021 LA datasets indicate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of baseline models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the validity of uncertainty estimation by analyzing a strong correlation between average uncertainty and equal error rate (EER) across different spoofing algorithms.
#### SimulS2S-LLM: Unlocking Simultaneous Inference of Speech LLMs for Speech-to-Speech Translation
 - **Authors:** Keqi Deng, Wenxi Chen, Xie Chen, Philip C. Woodland
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Computation and Language (cs.CL); Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)

 - **Abstract**
 Simultaneous speech translation (SST) outputs translations in parallel with streaming speech input, balancing translation quality and latency. While large language models (LLMs) have been extended to handle the speech modality, streaming remains challenging as speech is prepended as a prompt for the entire generation process. To unlock LLM streaming capability, this paper proposes SimulS2S-LLM, which trains speech LLMs offline and employs a test-time policy to guide simultaneous inference. SimulS2S-LLM alleviates the mismatch between training and inference by extracting boundary-aware speech prompts that allows it to be better matched with text input data. SimulS2S-LLM achieves simultaneous speech-to-speech translation (Simul-S2ST) by predicting discrete output speech tokens and then synthesising output speech using a pre-trained vocoder. An incremental beam search is designed to expand the search space of speech token prediction without increasing latency. Experiments on the CVSS speech data show that SimulS2S-LLM offers a better translation quality-latency trade-off than existing methods that use the same training data, such as improving ASR-BLEU scores by 3 points at similar latency.
#### Quantifying Source Speaker Leakage in One-to-One Voice Conversion

 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Sound (cs.SD); Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15822

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15822

 - **Abstract**
 Using a multi-accented corpus of parallel utterances for use with commercial speech devices, we present a case study to show that it is possible to quantify a degree of confidence about a source speaker's identity in the case of one-to-one voice conversion. Following voice conversion using a HiFi-GAN vocoder, we compare information leakage for a range speaker characteristics; assuming a "worst-case" white-box scenario, we quantify our confidence to perform inference and narrow the pool of likely source speakers, reinforcing the regulatory obligation and moral duty that providers of synthetic voices have to ensure the privacy of their speakers' data.
