 - **Abstract**
 This paper explores a novel perspective to speech quality assessment by leveraging natural language descriptions, offering richer, more nuanced insights than traditional numerical scoring methods. Natural language feedback provides instructive recommendations and detailed evaluations, yet existing datasets lack the comprehensive annotations needed for this approach. To bridge this gap, we introduce QualiSpeech, a comprehensive low-level speech quality assessment dataset encompassing 11 key aspects and detailed natural language comments that include reasoning and contextual insights. Additionally, we propose the QualiSpeech Benchmark to evaluate the low-level speech understanding capabilities of auditory large language models (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that finetuned auditory LLMs can reliably generate detailed descriptions of noise and distortion, effectively identifying their types and temporal characteristics. The results further highlight the potential for incorporating reasoning to enhance the accuracy and reliability of quality assessments. The dataset will be released at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) technology represents an innovative fiber-optic-based sensing methodology that enables real-time acoustic signal monitoring through the detection of minute perturbations along optical fibers. This sensing approach offers compelling advantages, including extensive measurement ranges, exceptional spatial resolution, and an expansive dynamic measurement spectrum. The integration of machine learning (ML) paradigms presents transformative potential for DAS technology, encompassing critical domains such as data augmentation, sophisticated preprocessing techniques, and advanced acoustic event classification and recognition. By leveraging ML algorithms, DAS systems can transition from traditional data processing methodologies to more automated and intelligent analytical frameworks. The computational intelligence afforded by ML-enhanced DAS technologies facilitates unprecedented monitoring capabilities across diverse critical infrastructure sectors. Particularly noteworthy are the technology's applications in transportation infrastructure, energy management systems, and Natural disaster monitoring frameworks, where the precision of data acquisition and the reliability of intelligent decision-making mechanisms are paramount. This research critically examines the comparative performance characteristics of classical machine learning methodologies and state-of-the-art deep learning models in the context of DAS data recognition and interpretation, offering comprehensive insights into the evolving landscape of intelligent sensing technologies.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20212

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20212

 - **Abstract**
 This report introduces Dolphin, a large-scale multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that extends the Whisper architecture to support a wider range of languages. Our approach integrates in-house proprietary and open-source datasets to refine and optimize Dolphin's performance. The model is specifically designed to achieve notable recognition accuracy for 40 Eastern languages across East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, while also supporting 22 Chinese dialects. Experimental evaluations show that Dolphin significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art open-source models across various languages. To promote reproducibility and community-driven innovation, we are making our trained models and inference source code publicly available.
#### Qwen2.5-Omni Technical Report

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20215

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20215

 - **Abstract**
 In this report, we present Qwen2.5-Omni, an end-to-end multimodal model designed to perceive diverse modalities, including text, images, audio, and video, while simultaneously generating text and natural speech responses in a streaming manner. To enable the streaming of multimodal information inputs, both audio and visual encoders utilize a block-wise processing approach. To synchronize the timestamps of video inputs with audio, we organize the audio and video sequentially in an interleaved manner and propose a novel position embedding approach, named TMRoPE(Time-aligned Multimodal RoPE). To concurrently generate text and speech while avoiding interference between the two modalities, we propose \textbf{Thinker-Talker} architecture. In this framework, Thinker functions as a large language model tasked with text generation, while Talker is a dual-track autoregressive model that directly utilizes the hidden representations from the Thinker to produce audio tokens as output. Both the Thinker and Talker models are designed to be trained and inferred in an end-to-end manner. For decoding audio tokens in a streaming manner, we introduce a sliding-window DiT that restricts the receptive field, aiming to reduce the initial package delay. Qwen2.5-Omni is comparable with the similarly sized Qwen2.5-VL and outperforms Qwen2-Audio. Furthermore, Qwen2.5-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal benchmarks like Omni-Bench. Notably, Qwen2.5-Omni's performance in end-to-end speech instruction following is comparable to its capabilities with text inputs, as evidenced by benchmarks such as MMLU and GSM8K. As for speech generation, Qwen2.5-Omni's streaming Talker outperforms most existing streaming and non-streaming alternatives in robustness and naturalness.
#### FireRedTTS-1S: An Upgraded Streamable Foundation Text-to-Speech System
 - **Authors:** Hao-Han Guo, Kun Xie, Yi-Chen Wu, Feng-Long Xie
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20499

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20499

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we propose a high-quality streaming foundation text-to-speech system, FireRedTTS-1S, upgraded from the streamable version of FireRedTTS. FireRedTTS-1S achieves streaming generation via two steps: text-to-semantic decoding and semantic-to-acoustic decoding. In text-to-semantic decoding, a semantic-aware speech tokenizer converts the speech signal into semantic tokens, which can be synthesized from the text via a semantic language model in an auto-regressive manner. Meanwhile, the semantic-to-acoustic decoding module simultaneously translates generated semantic tokens into the speech signal in a streaming way via a super-resolution causal audio codec and a multi-stream acoustic language model. This design enables us to produce high-quality speech audio in zero-shot settings while presenting a real-time generation process with low latency under 150ms. In experiments on zero-shot voice cloning, the objective results validate FireRedTTS-1S as a high-quality foundation model with comparable intelligibility and speaker similarity over industrial baseline systems. Furthermore, the subjective score of FireRedTTS-1S highlights its impressive synthesis performance, achieving comparable quality to the ground-truth recordings. These results validate FireRedTTS-1S as a high-quality streaming foundation TTS system.
