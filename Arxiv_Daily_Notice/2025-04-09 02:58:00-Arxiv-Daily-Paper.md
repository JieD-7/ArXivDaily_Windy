 - **Abstract**
 Speech foundation models have significantly advanced various speech-related tasks by providing exceptional representation capabilities. However, their high-dimensional output features often create a mismatch with downstream task models, which typically require lower-dimensional inputs. A common solution is to apply a dimensionality reduction (DR) layer, but this approach increases parameter overhead, computational costs, and risks losing valuable information. To address these issues, we propose Nested Res2Net (Nes2Net), a lightweight back-end architecture designed to directly process high-dimensional features without DR layers. The nested structure enhances multi-scale feature extraction, improves feature interaction, and preserves high-dimensional information. We first validate Nes2Net on CtrSVDD, a singing voice deepfake detection dataset, and report a 22% performance improvement and an 87% back-end computational cost reduction over the state-of-the-art baseline. Additionally, extensive testing across four diverse datasets: ASVspoof 2021, ASVspoof 5, PartialSpoof, and In-the-Wild, covering fully spoofed speech, adversarial attacks, partial spoofing, and real-world scenarios, consistently highlights Nes2Net's superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

#### Exploring Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations for Speech Emotion Recognition with Distribution-Shift
 - **Authors:** Maja J. Hjuler, Line H. Clemmensen, Sneha Das
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05368

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05368

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce EmoLIME, a version of local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) for black-box Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply LIME in SER. EmoLIME generates high-level interpretable explanations and identifies which specific frequency ranges are most influential in determining emotional states. The approach aids in interpreting complex, high-dimensional embeddings such as those generated by end-to-end speech models. We evaluate EmoLIME, qualitatively, quantitatively, and statistically, across three emotional speech datasets, using classifiers trained on both hand-crafted acoustic features and Wav2Vec 2.0 embeddings. We find that EmoLIME exhibits stronger robustness across different models than across datasets with distribution shifts, highlighting its potential for more consistent explanations in SER tasks within a dataset.
#### Réduire le bruit grâce à la réalité augmentée sonore -- Auditory Concealer
 - **Authors:** Clara Boukhemia
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05847

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05847

 - **Abstract**
 This report presents the work done over 22 weeks of internship within the Sound Perception and Design team of the Sciences and Technologies of Music and Sound (STMS) laboratory at the Institute for Research and Coordination in Acoustics/Music (IRCAM). As part of the launch of the project Reducing Noise with Augmented Reality (ReNAR); which aims to create a tool to reduce in real-time the cognitive impact of sounds perceived as unpleasant or annoying in indoor environments; an initial study was conducted to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of a new masking approach called concealer. The main hypothesis is that the concealer approach could provide better results than a masker approach in terms of perceived pleasantness. Mixtures of two noise sources (ventilation) and five masking sounds (water sounds) were generated using both approaches at various levels. The evaluation of the perceived pleasantness of these mixtures showed that the masker approach remains more effective than the concealer approach, regardless of the noise source, water sound, or level used.
