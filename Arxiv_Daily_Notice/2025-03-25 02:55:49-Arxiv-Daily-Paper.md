 - **Abstract**
 The objective of this study is to generate high-quality speech from silent talking face videos, a task also known as video-to-speech synthesis. A significant challenge in video-to-speech synthesis lies in the substantial modality gap between silent video and multi-faceted speech. In this paper, we propose a novel video-to-speech system that effectively bridges this modality gap, significantly enhancing the quality of synthesized speech. This is achieved by learning of hierarchical representations from video to speech. Specifically, we gradually transform silent video into acoustic feature spaces through three sequential stages -- content, timbre, and prosody modeling. In each stage, we align visual factors -- lip movements, face identity, and facial expressions -- with corresponding acoustic counterparts to ensure the seamless transformation. Additionally, to generate realistic and coherent speech from the visual representations, we employ a flow matching model that estimates direct trajectories from a simple prior distribution to the target speech distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves exceptional generation quality comparable to real utterances, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin.
#### SeniorTalk: A Chinese Conversation Dataset with Rich Annotations for Super-Aged Seniors

 - **Abstract**
 While voice technologies increasingly serve aging populations, current systems exhibit significant performance gaps due to inadequate training data capturing elderly-specific vocal characteristics like presbyphonia and dialectal variations. The limited data available on super-aged individuals in existing elderly speech datasets, coupled with overly simple recording styles and annotation dimensions, exacerbates this issue. To address the critical scarcity of speech data from individuals aged 75 and above, we introduce SeniorTalk, a carefully annotated Chinese spoken dialogue dataset. This dataset contains 55.53 hours of speech from 101 natural conversations involving 202 participants, ensuring a strategic balance across gender, region, and age. Through detailed annotation across multiple dimensions, it can support a wide range of speech tasks. We perform extensive experiments on speaker verification, speaker diarization, speech recognition, and speech editing tasks, offering crucial insights for the development of speech technologies targeting this age group.
#### Learning disentangled representations for instrument-based music similarity

 - **Abstract**
 A flexible recommendation and retrieval system requires music similarity in terms of multiple partial elements of musical pieces to allow users to select the element they want to focus on. A method for music similarity learning using multiple networks with individual instrumental signals is effective but faces the problem that using each clean instrumental signal as a query is impractical for retrieval systems and using separated instrumental sounds reduces accuracy owing to artifacts. In this paper, we present instrumental-part-based music similarity learning with a single network that takes mixed sounds as input instead of individual instrumental sounds. Specifically, we designed a single similarity embedding space with disentangled dimensions for each instrument, extracted by Conditional Similarity Networks, which are trained using the triplet loss with masks. Experimental results showed that (1) the proposed method can obtain more accurate feature representation than using individual networks using separated sounds as input in the evaluation of an instrument that had low accuracy, (2) each sub-embedding space can hold the characteristics of the corresponding instrument, and (3) the selection of similar musical pieces focusing on each instrumental sound by the proposed method can obtain human acceptance, especially when focusing on timbre.
