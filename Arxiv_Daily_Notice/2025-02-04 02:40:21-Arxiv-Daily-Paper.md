#### Language Bias in Self-Supervised Learning For Automatic Speech Recognition
 - **Authors:** Edward Storey, Naomi Harte, Peter Bell
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Signal Processing (eess.SP)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.19321

 - **Abstract**
 Self-supervised learning (SSL) is used in deep learning to train on large datasets without the need for expensive labelling of the data. Recently, large Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models such as XLS-R have utilised SSL to train on over one hundred different languages simultaneously. However, deeper investigation shows that the bulk of the training data for XLS-R comes from a small number of languages. Biases learned through SSL have been shown to exist in multiple domains, but language bias in multilingual SSL ASR has not been thoroughly examined. In this paper, we utilise the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to identify language-specific subnetworks within XLS-R and test the performance of these subnetworks on a variety of different languages. We are able to show that when fine-tuning, XLS-R bypasses traditional linguistic knowledge and builds only on weights learned from the languages with the largest data contribution to the pretraining data.
#### Exploring Audio Editing Features as User-Centric Privacy Defenses Against Emotion Inference Attacks

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid proliferation of speech-enabled technologies, including virtual assistants, video conferencing platforms, and wearable devices, has raised significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding the inference of sensitive emotional information from audio data. Existing privacy-preserving methods often compromise usability and security, limiting their adoption in practical scenarios. This paper introduces a novel, user-centric approach that leverages familiar audio editing techniques, specifically pitch and tempo manipulation, to protect emotional privacy without sacrificing usability. By analyzing popular audio editing applications on Android and iOS platforms, we identified these features as both widely available and usable. We rigorously evaluated their effectiveness against a threat model, considering adversarial attacks from diverse sources, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and and reversibility testing. Our experiments, conducted on three distinct datasets, demonstrate that pitch and tempo manipulation effectively obfuscates emotional data. Additionally, we explore the design principles for lightweight, on-device implementation to ensure broad applicability across various devices and platforms.
#### Deepfake Detection of Singing Voices With Whisper Encodings
 - **Authors:** Falguni Sharma, Priyanka Gupta
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Sound (cs.SD); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18919

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18919

 - **Abstract**
 The deepfake generation of singing vocals is a concerning issue for artists in the music industry. In this work, we propose a singing voice deepfake detection (SVDD) system, which uses noise-variant encodings of open-AI's Whisper model. As counter-intuitive as it may sound, even though the Whisper model is known to be noise-robust, the encodings are rich in non-speech information, and are noise-variant. This leads us to evaluate Whisper encodings as feature representations for the SVDD task. Therefore, in this work, the SVDD task is performed on vocals and mixtures, and the performance is evaluated in \%EER over varying Whisper model sizes and two classifiers- CNN and ResNet34, under different testing conditions.
#### DyPCL: Dynamic Phoneme-level Contrastive Learning for Dysarthric Speech Recognition
 - **Authors:** Wonjun Lee, Solee Im, Heejin Do, Yunsu Kim, Jungseul Ok, Gary Geunbae Lee
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Computation and Language (cs.CL); Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19010

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.19010

 - **Abstract**
 Dysarthric speech recognition often suffers from performance degradation due to the intrinsic diversity of dysarthric severity and extrinsic disparity from normal speech. To bridge these gaps, we propose a Dynamic Phoneme-level Contrastive Learning (DyPCL) method, which leads to obtaining invariant representations across diverse speakers. We decompose the speech utterance into phoneme segments for phoneme-level contrastive learning, leveraging dynamic connectionist temporal classification alignment. Unlike prior studies focusing on utterance-level embeddings, our granular learning allows discrimination of subtle parts of speech. In addition, we introduce dynamic curriculum learning, which progressively transitions from easy negative samples to difficult-to-distinguishable negative samples based on phonetic similarity of phoneme. Our approach to training by difficulty levels alleviates the inherent variability of speakers, better identifying challenging speeches. Evaluated on the UASpeech dataset, DyPCL outperforms baseline models, achieving an average 22.10\% relative reduction in word error rate (WER) across the overall dysarthria group.
#### SELMA: A Speech-Enabled Language Model for Virtual Assistant Interactions
 - **Authors:** Dominik Wagner, Alexander Churchill, Siddarth Sigtia, Erik Marchi
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Sound (cs.SD); Computation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19377

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.19377

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present and evaluate SELMA, a Speech-Enabled Language Model for virtual Assistant interactions that integrates audio and text as inputs to a Large Language Model (LLM). SELMA is designed to handle three primary and two auxiliary tasks related to interactions with virtual assistants simultaneously within a single end-to-end model. We employ low-rank adaptation modules for parameter-efficient training of both the audio encoder and the LLM. Additionally, we implement a feature pooling strategy enabling the system to recognize global patterns and improve accuracy on tasks less reliant on individual sequence elements. Experimental results on Voice Trigger (VT) detection, Device-Directed Speech Detection (DDSD), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), demonstrate that our approach both simplifies the typical input processing pipeline of virtual assistants significantly and also improves performance compared to dedicated models for each individual task. SELMA yields relative Equal-Error Rate improvements of 64% on the VT detection task, and 22% on DDSD, while also achieving word error rates close to the baseline.
