#### Modeling L1 Influence on L2 Pronunciation: An MFCC-Based Framework for Explainable Machine Learning and Pedagogical Feedback
 - **Authors:** Peyman Jahanbin
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS); Sound (cs.SD)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13765

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13765

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the extent to which Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) capture first language (L1) transfer in extended second language (L2) English speech. Speech samples from Mandarin and American English L1 speakers were extracted from the GMU Speech Accent Archive, converted to WAV format, and processed to obtain thirteen MFCCs per speaker. A multi-method analytic framework combining inferential statistics (t-tests, MANOVA, Canonical Discriminant Analysis) and machine learning (Random Forest classification) identified MFCC-1 (broadband energy), MFCC-2 (first formant region), and MFCC-5 (voicing and fricative energy) as the most discriminative features for distinguishing L1 backgrounds. A reduced-feature model using these MFCCs significantly outperformed the full-feature model, as confirmed by McNemar's test and non-overlapping confidence intervals. The findings empirically support the Perceptual Assimilation Model for L2 (PAM-L2) and the Speech Learning Model (SLM), demonstrating that L1-conditioned variation in L2 speech is both perceptually grounded and acoustically quantifiable. Methodologically, the study contributes to applied linguistics and explainable AI by proposing a transparent, data-efficient pipeline for L2 pronunciation modeling. The results also offer pedagogical implications for ESL/EFL instruction by highlighting L1-specific features that can inform intelligibility-oriented instruction, curriculum design, and speech assessment tools.
#### Acoustic to Articulatory Inversion of Speech; Data Driven Approaches, Challenges, Applications, and Future Scope
 - **Authors:** Leena G Pillai, D. Muhammad Noorul Mubarak
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Sound (cs.SD); Computation and Language (cs.CL); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13308

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13308

 - **Abstract**
 This review is focused on the data-driven approaches applied in different applications of Acoustic-to-Articulatory Inversion (AAI) of speech. This review paper considered the relevant works published in the last ten years (2011-2021). The selection criteria includes (a) type of AAI - Speaker Dependent and Speaker Independent AAI, (b) objectives of the work - Articulatory approximation, Articulatory Feature space selection and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), explore the correlation between acoustic and articulatory features, and framework for Computer-assisted language training, (c) Corpus - Simultaneously recorded speech (wav) and medical imaging models such as ElectroMagnetic Articulography (EMA), Electropalatography (EPG), Laryngography, Electroglottography (EGG), X-ray Cineradiography, Ultrasound, and real-time Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rtMRI), (d) Methods or models - recent works are considered, and therefore all the works are based on machine learning, (e) Evaluation - as AAI is a non-linear regression problem, the performance evaluation is mostly done by Correlation Coefficient (CC), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and also considered Mean Square Error (MSE), and Mean Format Error (MFE). The practical application of the AAI model can provide a better and user-friendly interpretable image feedback system of articulatory positions, especially tongue movement. Such trajectory feedback system can be used to provide phonetic, language, and speech therapy for pathological subjects.
#### Collective Learning Mechanism based Optimal Transport Generative Adversarial Network for Non-parallel Voice Conversion
 - **Authors:** Sandipan Dhar, Md. Tousin Akhter, Nanda Dulal Jana, Swagatam Das
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Sound (cs.SD); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)

 - **Abstract**
 After demonstrating significant success in image synthesis, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models have likewise made significant progress in the field of speech synthesis, leveraging their capacity to adapt the precise distribution of target data through adversarial learning processes. Notably, in the realm of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) GAN-based Voice Conversion (VC) models, there exists a substantial disparity in naturalness between real and GAN-generated speech samples. Furthermore, while many GAN models currently operate on a single generator discriminator learning approach, optimizing target data distribution is more effectively achievable through a single generator multi-discriminator learning scheme. Hence, this study introduces a novel GAN model named Collective Learning Mechanism-based Optimal Transport GAN (CLOT-GAN) model, incorporating multiple discriminators, including the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model, Vision Transformer (ViT), and conformer. The objective of integrating various discriminators lies in their ability to comprehend the formant distribution of mel-spectrograms, facilitated by a collective learning mechanism. Simultaneously, the inclusion of Optimal Transport (OT) loss aims to precisely bridge the gap between the source and target data distribution, employing the principles of OT theory. The experimental validation on VCC 2018, VCTK, and CMU-Arctic datasets confirms that the CLOT-GAN-VC model outperforms existing VC models in objective and subjective assessments.
