 - **Abstract**
 This paper describes the synthesis of the room acoustics challenge as a part of the generative data augmentation workshop at ICASSP 2025. The challenge defines a unique generative task that is designed to improve the quantity and diversity of the room impulse responses dataset so that it can be used for spatially sensitive downstream tasks: speaker distance estimation. The challenge identifies the technical difficulty in measuring or simulating many rooms' acoustic characteristics precisely. As a solution, it proposes generative data augmentation as an alternative that can potentially be used to improve various downstream tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a new challenge that calls for zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems to augment speech data for the downstream task, personalized speech enhancement (PSE), as part of the Generative Data Augmentation workshop at ICASSP 2025. Collecting high-quality personalized data is challenging due to privacy concerns and technical difficulties in recording audio from the test scene. To address these issues, synthetic data generation using generative models has gained significant attention. In this challenge, participants are tasked first with building zero-shot TTS systems to augment personalized data. Subsequently, PSE systems are asked to be trained with this augmented personalized dataset. Through this challenge, we aim to investigate how the quality of augmented data generated by zero-shot TTS models affects PSE model performance. We also provide baseline experiments using open-source zero-shot TTS models to encourage participation and benchmark advancements. Our baseline code implementation and checkpoints are available online.

 - **Abstract**
 The a posteriori speech presence probability (SPP) is the fundamental component of noise power spectral density (PSD) estimation, which can contribute to speech enhancement and speech recognition systems. Most existing SPP estimators can estimate SPP accurately from the background noise. Nevertheless, numerous challenges persist, including the difficulty of accurately estimating SPP from non-stationary noise with statistics-based methods and the high latency associated with deep learning-based approaches. This paper presents an improved SPP estimation approach based on deep learning to achieve higher SPP estimation accuracy, especially in non-stationary noise conditions. To promote the information extraction performance of the DNN, the global information of the observed signal and the local information of the decoupled frequency bins from the observed signal are connected as hybrid global-local information. The global information is extracted by one encoder. Then, one decoder and two fully connected layers are used to estimate SPP from the information of residual connection. To evaluate the performance of our proposed SPP estimator, the noise PSD estimation and speech enhancement tasks are performed. In contrast to existing minimum mean-square error (MMSE)-based noise PSD estimation approaches, the noise PSD is estimated by the sub-optimal MMSE based on the current frame SPP estimate without smoothing. Directed by the noise PSD estimate, a standard speech enhancement framework, the log spectral amplitude estimator, is employed to extract clean speech from the observed signal. From the experimental results, we can confirm that our proposed SPP estimator can achieve high noise PSD estimation accuracy and speech enhancement performance while requiring low model complexity.

 - **Abstract**
 Large language models (LLMs) for audio have excelled in recognizing and analyzing human speech, music, and environmental sounds. However, their potential for understanding other types of sounds, particularly biomedical sounds, remains largely underexplored despite significant scientific interest. In this study, we focus on diagnosing cardiovascular diseases using phonocardiograms, i.e., heart sounds. Most existing deep neural network (DNN) paradigms are restricted to heart murmur classification (healthy vs unhealthy) and do not predict other acoustic features of the murmur such as timing, grading, harshness, pitch, and quality, which are important in helping physicians diagnose the underlying heart conditions. We propose to finetune an audio LLM, Qwen2-Audio, on the PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope phonocardiogram (PCG) dataset and evaluate its performance in classifying 11 expert-labeled murmur features. Additionally, we aim to achieve more noise-robust and generalizable system by exploring a preprocessing segmentation algorithm using an audio representation model, SSAMBA. Our results indicate that the LLM-based model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 8 of the 11 features and performs comparably in the remaining 3. Moreover, the LLM successfully classifies long-tail murmur features with limited training data, a task that all previous methods have failed to classify. These findings underscore the potential of audio LLMs as assistants to human cardiologists in enhancing heart disease diagnosis.

 - **Abstract**
 Speech Enhancement (SE) aims to improve the quality of noisy speech. It has been shown that additional visual cues can further improve performance. Given that speech communication involves audio, visual, and linguistic modalities, it is natural to expect another performance boost by incorporating linguistic information. However, bridging the modality gaps to efficiently incorporate linguistic information, along with audio and visual modalities during knowledge transfer, is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modality learning framework for SE. In the model framework, a state-of-the-art diffusion Model backbone is utilized for Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement (AVSE) modeling where both audio and visual information are directly captured by microphones and video cameras. Based on this AVSE, the linguistic modality employs a PLM to transfer linguistic knowledge to the visual acoustic modality through a process termed Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer (CMKT) during AVSE model training. After the model is trained, it is supposed that linguistic knowledge is encoded in the feature processing of the AVSE model by the CMKT, and the PLM will not be involved during inference stage. We carry out SE experiments to evaluate the proposed model framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed AVSE system significantly enhances speech quality and reduces generative artifacts, such as phonetic confusion compared to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, our visualization results demonstrate that our Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer method further improves the generated speech quality of our AVSE system. These findings not only suggest that Diffusion Model-based techniques hold promise for advancing the state-of-the-art in AVSE but also justify the effectiveness of incorporating linguistic information to improve the performance of Diffusion-based AVSE systems.
#### Neural Vocoders as Speech Enhancers

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13465

 - **Abstract**
 Speech enhancement (SE) and neural vocoding are traditionally viewed as separate tasks. In this work, we observe them under a common thread: the rank behavior of these processes. This observation prompts two key questions: \textit{Can a model designed for one task's rank degradation be adapted for the other?} and \textit{Is it possible to address both tasks using a unified model?} Our empirical findings demonstrate that existing speech enhancement models can be successfully trained to perform vocoding tasks, and a single model, when jointly trained, can effectively handle both tasks with performance comparable to separately trained models. These results suggest that speech enhancement and neural vocoding can be unified under a broader framework of speech restoration. Code: this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 Data2vec is a self-supervised learning (SSL) approach that employs a teacher-student architecture for contextual representation learning via masked prediction, demonstrating remarkable performance in monolingual ASR. Previous studies have revealed that data2vec's shallow layers capture speaker and language information, middle layers encode phoneme and word features, while deep layers are responsible for reconstruction. Language and phoneme features are crucial for multilingual ASR. However, data2vec's masked representation generation relies on multi-layer averaging, inevitably coupling these features. To address this limitation, we propose a decoupling quantization based data2vec (DQ-Data2vec) for multilingual ASR, which includes a data2vec backbone and two improved online K-means quantizers. Our core idea is using the K-means quantizer with specified cluster numbers to decouple language and phoneme information for masked prediction. Specifically, in the language quantization, considering that the number of languages is significantly different from other irrelevant features (e.g., speakers), we assign the cluster number to match the number of languages, explicitly decoupling shallow layers' language-related information from irrelevant features. This strategy is also applied to decoupling middle layers' phoneme and word features. In a self-supervised scenario, experiments on the CommonVoice dataset demonstrate that DQ-Data2vec achieves a relative reduction of 9.51% in phoneme error rate (PER) and 11.58% in word error rate (WER) compared to data2vec and UniData2vec. Moreover, in a weakly-supervised scenario incorporating language labels and high-resource language text labels, the relative reduction is 18.09% and 1.55%, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable zero-shot performance across various natural language processing tasks. The integration of multimodal encoders extends their capabilities, enabling the development of Multimodal Large Language Models that process vision, audio, and text. However, these capabilities also raise significant security concerns, as these models can be manipulated to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak. While extensive research explores the impact of modality-specific input edits on text-based LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models in jailbreak, the effects of audio-specific edits on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remain underexplored. Hence, this paper addresses this gap by investigating how audio-specific edits influence LALMs inference regarding jailbreak. We introduce the Audio Editing Toolbox (AET), which enables audio-modality edits such as tone adjustment, word emphasis, and noise injection, and the Edited Audio Datasets (EADs), a comprehensive audio jailbreak benchmark. We also conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LALMs to assess their robustness under different audio edits. This work lays the groundwork for future explorations on audio-modality interactions in LALMs security.
#### Everyone-Can-Sing: Zero-Shot Singing Voice Synthesis and Conversion with Speech Reference

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13870

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13870

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a unified framework for Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) and Conversion (SVC), addressing the limitations of existing approaches in cross-domain SVS/SVC, poor output musicality, and scarcity of singing data. Our framework enables control over multiple aspects, including language content based on lyrics, performance attributes based on a musical score, singing style and vocal techniques based on a selector, and voice identity based on a speech sample. The proposed zero-shot learning paradigm consists of one SVS model and two SVC models, utilizing pre-trained content embeddings and a diffusion-based generator. The proposed framework is also trained on mixed datasets comprising both singing and speech audio, allowing singing voice cloning based on speech reference. Experiments show substantial improvements in timbre similarity and musicality over state-of-the-art baselines, providing insights into other low-data music tasks such as instrumental style transfer.

 - **Abstract**
 Adding explanations to audio deepfake detection (ADD) models will boost their real-world application by providing insight on the decision making process. In this paper, we propose a relevancy-based explainable AI (XAI) method to analyze the predictions of transformer-based ADD models. We compare against standard Grad-CAM and SHAP-based methods, using quantitative faithfulness metrics as well as a partial spoof test, to comprehensively analyze the relative importance of different temporal regions in an audio. We consider large datasets, unlike previous works where only limited utterances are studied, and find that the XAI methods differ in their explanations. The proposed relevancy-based XAI method performs the best overall on a variety of metrics. Further investigation on the relative importance of speech/non-speech, phonetic content, and voice onsets/offsets suggest that the XAI results obtained from analyzing limited utterances don't necessarily hold when evaluated on large datasets.
